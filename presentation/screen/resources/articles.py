Other high deficits were 4.2 per cent recorded in 2009-10 during the global financial crisis and 4.1 per cent in 1992-93.\n\nData predating what is contained in the budget papers illustrate that, similar to debt levels, Australian budget deficits were higher during and following the two world wars.\n\nIn 2015, Fact Check noted that graphs contained in the research paper commissioned by Centric Wealth showed that the budget deficit reached more than 10 per cent of GDP during World War I and more than 20 per cent of GDP during World War II — more than double the level reached in 2020-21."},

Historical figures for taxation, borrowing and spending as a percentage of GDP can be found in the budget papers.\n\nThis data is presented in financial years, which doesn\'t match up neatly with elections.\n\nFinancial year 2007-08 has been designated the first year of Labor\'s government, given that Kevin Rudd was prime minister for most of that year.\n\nSimilarly, 2013-14 has been allocated to the Coalition. The election was held only three months into the financial year, and then treasurer Joe Hockey subsequently announced billions of dollars worth of changes to taxes and spending in his December 2013 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.\n\nThe most recent financial year for which actual results are available is 2020-21.

Similarly, for net debt the figures are \"Australian Government general government sector net debt\".\n\nThe Rudd-Gillard government\'s average gross debt was 11.7 per cent of GDP and net debt average was 4.4 per cent of GDP.\n\nThis compares with a Coalition average of 28.4 per cent on gross debt and 19.5 per cent on net debt.

It does not tell you much at all about Labor or the Coalition as managers.\"\n\n\"The size of the storm [each financial crisis] dominates the underlying answer, and doesn\'t really tell us anything about the budgetary habits of one side or the other. Australia, in my view, is great at managing a crisis but bad at managing chronic problems such as climate change or economic reform or budget repair.\"\n\nMr Richardson said Labor and the Coalition governments both fought their respective financial crises \"really well\".\n\n\"But we struggle more with the chronic challenges, and the big task of the new government will be to successfully engage with chronic problems.\"\n\nHe noted Labor governed through a commodity boom and a global financial crisis, and the Coalition began its nine years \"in the grinding aftermath\" of that crisis. But he said budget data in isolation does not explain the drivers behind those figures, in particular global economic conditions and commodities prices.\n\n\"You can do the numbers,\" he said. \"But if you are assuming that it tells you anything about the values or capabilities of one [political party] or another, then you are missing the point. And the point is: \'It\'s the economy, stupid\'.\"\n\n\"If you believe this [data] has much to do with government capability, of one party or another, then, as a budget economist, I can tell you that\'s \'hooey\'. The global economy is the overwhelming driver.\""},

Ron DeSantis for signing into law HB 1557, dubbed the \"don’t say gay\" bill by critics. The legislation prohibits classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.\n\nThen the mayor announced an ad campaign to address the issue. \n\nFor eight weeks — starting April 4 — five pieces of creative art condemning the law will be displayed on billboards across major cities in Florida.

The number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic.\"\n\nWe were surprised to hear that statistic about small businesses, given that a pandemic-induced recession clobbered restaurants and other small companies.\n\nSo we dug into it, and found that Biden had misstated a real statistic.\n\nThe White House referred us to Census Bureau data that tracks how many Americans are applying for employer identification numbers, a step in the process of starting a new payroll. Economists often use this as a proxy for small business creation.\n\nIn the most recent month for which data is available, October 2021, the data shows that 52,277 applications were made.

Notably, it doesn’t account for the number of businesses that have failed. (The latest available government data on the total number of businesses is a couple of years old.)\n\n\"The president should have said something like, ‘The number of new small businesses created in recent months is up 30% compared to the months immediately before the pandemic,’\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhen we shared this feedback with the White House, they pointed to a speech the previous week where Biden said the talking point correctly.\n\nEconomists said that Biden’s poor phrasing in his Dec. 1 remarks effectively stepped on a positive message for the administration: Small business creation has indeed been strong recently.\n\n\"The recovery from the pandemic has been associated with a surge\" in new small businesses, said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist. That includes entities that expect to hire staff, which is the statistic the White House was using, and those that expect to remain one-person operations.\n\nStill, we don’t know how strong this small business growth is on net without knowing how many small businesses shuttered during the pandemic."},

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that New York did lead the states in lost population between July 2020 and July 2021, although the losses were not as steep between the full decennial censuses of 2010 and 2020.\n\nWhen we contacted Zeldin’s office, a spokesperson cited an article from December 2021 in the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle that summarized newly released Census data. \n\nAccording to data released by the bureau in December 2021, New York dropped below 20 million people between July 2020 and July 2021, decreasing from 20.15 million to 19.84 million.\n\nThat’s a decline of 1.58%, which was the largest percentage loss for any state during that period. (New York also had the largest loss in raw numbers — 319,000 — although statisticians usually prefer to compare states by percentage losses, because some states, like New York, are much larger to start with.)\n\nSixteen other states lost population during that yearlong period. The states with losses closest to New York were Illinois, with a decline of 0.89%; Hawaii, with a decline of 0.71%; California, with a decline of 0.66%; and Louisiana, with a decline of 0.58%.\n\n"},

Net foreign immigration to New York decreased during the one-year period to just 18,860 people, which the Empire Center said was the smallest number in at least 60 years.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic also increased the number of deaths in New York, although there were enough births in the state to exceed deaths of all causes by 18,503.\n\nThe data showing the change in population between July 2020 and July 2021 is based on estimates rather than the full-scale census count that is conducted every 10 years. And the data on population change between the last two censuses, 2010 and 2020, show that New York was not quite so cursed on the population front over that longer period.\n\nOn average during that decade, New York’s population grew by 0.42% per year, rather than shrinking. That was a bit below the 50-state median; New York had the 32nd fastest growth rate during that period. Only three states lost population during that decade: Illinois, Mississippi and West Virginia.

Adding them would lower the percentages for the non-college degree group.\n\nLike Warren, the White House has also relied on the national center’s data. It counted borrowers a slightly different way and estimated that about a third of borrowers didn’t get a college degree. But that excluded the 20% of students with certificates or associate degrees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances for 2019 found that for 43% of households with education debt, the person answering the survey questions did not have a college degree. \n\nThe survey also leaves some gaps. First, it counts  households, and Warren was talking about individuals. That means the survey can tell us only that someone in the household had student debt.\n\nAlso, the person answering the questions might not be the borrower, such as a parent without a college degree who has a child in college.\n\n\"Because we don’t know whose student debt it is, we’re not able to make a direct connection to completion status,\" said Jason Jabbari, assistant professor in the Social Policy Institute at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n"},

Jabbari cautions that his number might not be nationally representative because of his focus on lower-earning people, but Warren’s number is in line with it. \n\nLooney said to fully vet Warren’s claim, \"there are not great answers available.\" At the same time, he said her figure \"is a pretty good guess.\"\n\nEconomist Dora Gicheva at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro pointed to a 2009 study of student borrowers. Based on that work, she calculated that 33% had a college degree after five years, leaving 67% without one. The data Gicheva cited is more than a decade old, but it also bolsters Warren’s figures."},

With tens of millions of borrowers, that 2.9% adds up to tens of thousands of people.  (Though Warren mentioned nail technicians, there is no specific program for manicurists.) \n\nFour health care-related programs — each with educational paths shorter than four years — account for 7% of all student borrowers. There is no simple way to tie these programs to specific job titles, but depending on a state’s rules, they would include nursing aides.\n\nAmong the 20 programs most used by borrowers, those shorter than four years account for about a third of borrowers."},
