 abstract = {With the rapid growth of online misinformation, it is crucial to have
reliable fact-checking methods. Recent research on finding checkworthy
claims and automated fact-checking have made significant
advancements. However, limited guidance exists regarding the presentation
of fact-checked content to effectively convey verified
information to users.We address this research gap by exploring the
critical design elements in fact-checking reports and investigating
whether credibility and presentation-based design improvements
can enhance users' ability to interpret the report accurately. We
co-developed potential content presentation strategies through a
workshop involving fact-checking professionals, communication
experts, and researchers. The workshop examined the significance
and utility of elements such as veracity indicators and explored the
feasibility of incorporating interactive components for enhanced
information disclosure. Building on the workshop outcomes, we
conducted an online experiment involving 76 crowd workers to
assess the efficacy of different design strategies. The results indicate
that proposed strategies significantly improve users’ ability to accurately
interpret the verdict of fact-checking articles. Our findings
underscore the critical role of effective presentation of fact reports
in addressing the spread of misinformation. By adopting appropriate
design enhancements, the effectiveness of fact-checking reports
can be maximized, enabling users to make informed judgments.},
